Here are key strategies to optimize your usage:
Batch your requests: Group related questions or tasks into a single message instead of sending them separately. Ask multiple questions at once, especially when working with long documents.
Use Projects effectively: When working on related tasks, use our Project feature to store relevant documents in the knowledge base. When you add documents to a project, they're cached, and every time you reference that content, cached tokens count less toward your usage limits.
Avoid re-uploading files: Don't re-upload files within the same conversation since Claude remembers the context from your conversation.
Start new conversations strategically: Begin new chats for different topics or tasks rather than continuing lengthy conversations.
Review and edit messages: Before sending, ensure clarity and reduce follow-ups by being specific and concise in your initial requests.
These practices will help you extend your usage time before hitting the five-hour reset limits on your Pro Plan.
